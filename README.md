# birthday-paradox
This will be an attempt to create a program that tries out the birthday paradox, with the added option of being able to increase the amount of people.

Based on [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem).

# The goal:

* Be able to generate a number of people
* Each person has a name and a date of birth
* The people can be compared to see if any birthdays match
* See the math behind all of this
